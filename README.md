AlgoTemplates
===

I'll backup and share some of my codes in competitive programming here.

A guy forked my old template before I pruged them. See: [here] (https://github.com/wangxiaodiu/ACM)

Design
===

I use Emacs and C++ (Maybe C with STL? LOL )

- Java is fat, slow and sometimes tricky.
- CodeForces, TopCoder and Russian OJs support c++11 well. So I use C++11
- Emacs works well with GNU toolkits and can be "deep" configured by emacs lisp

Usage
===

- 'make install' to copy this template to your ~/
- Patch emacs_config.txt to your ~/.emacs
- M-x havefun to create a new problem solver from basic_temp.cpp
- <F5> for compile
- <F6> for debug
