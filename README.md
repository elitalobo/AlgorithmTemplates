AlgoTemplates
===

I'll backup and share some of my codes in competitive programming here.

A guy forked my old template before I pruged them. See: [here] (https://github.com/wangxiaodiu/ACM)

Design
===

I use Emacs and C++ (Maybe C with STL? LOL)

- Java is too huge and sometimes tricky for algorithm games.
- CodeForces, TopCoder and Russian OJs support c++11 very well.
- Emacs works well with GNU toolkits and can be "deep" configured by emacs lisp

Usage
===
- 'make' to run a unit test
- 'make install' to copy this template to your ~/
- Patch emacs_config.txt to your ~/.emacs or simply replace and wish it works...
- M-x havefun to create a new problem solver from basic_temp.cpp
- F5 for compile
- F6 for debug
