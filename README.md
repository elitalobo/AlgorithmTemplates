AlgoTemplates
===

I'll backup and share some of my codes in competitive programming here.

A guy forked my old template before I pruged them. See: [here] (https://github.com/wangxiaodiu/ACM)

Design
===

I use Emacs and C++ (Maybe C with STL? LOL )

- Java is sometimes slow and tricky. Java has some useful features like BigInteger, isProbablePrime() and regex, but it's not used very often in programming contests. I think it's OK to use C++.

- I often work on CodeForces, TopCoder and Russian OJs. They have good c++11 support. So I use C++11 here.

- Emacs works well with GNU toolkits and can be "deep" configured by emacs lisp.

Usage
===

- 'make install' to copy this template to your ~/
- Patch emacs_config.txt to your ~/.emacs
- M-x havefun to create a new problem solver from basic_temp.cpp
- <F5> for compile
- <F6> for debug
